# Key Logger with Python

For this key logger to work you will have to have `python`, `pip` and `pynput` installed.

# Install Python

Link: https://www.python.org/downloads/

# Install Pynput

Command line: `pip install pynput`

# Clone this repo

`git clone https://github.com/mellepella/key-logger.git` 

# PS...

In the current version the key-logger can only be closed in the task manager and its window will be hidden. To make sure it works, try to write something and then check the log.txt where your keypresses will be stored. To close the key-logger, go to your task manager and look for a task called python and close it. 
To avoid having to go into the log file everytime you want to clear the keypresses and delete everything by hand, you only have to run the `clearlog.py` file. (NOTE: EVERY keypress will be erased after running this program and you will not be able to get it back once you've cleared the file)
